# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- High-performance Go ICAP WAF server replacing the legacy Python implementation, eliminating GIL bottlenecks and solving memory leak issues
- Strict client-side Zod validation in the React Settings page preventing malformed configurations
- Idempotency-Key header support for configuration mutation endpoints (`/api/settings`, `/api/maintenance/reload-config`, `/api/maintenance/clear-cache`) to prevent duplicate operations

### Changed
- Replaced broad `except Exception as e` blocks in backend Python scripts with specific exception handling (e.g. `sqlite3.Error`, `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, `OSError`)
- Migrated backend unit tests from Flask conventions to `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`

## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Playwright end-to-end test suite: 59 tests across auth, API, and all UI pages; runs in Docker via `docker-compose.test.yml`
- Bulk Add panel in Blacklists: paste multiple IPs or domains (one per line) via textarea, processed by `/api/blacklists/import`
- Proxy address copy banner on the Dashboard showing `host:3128` with a one-click copy button
- Configurable WebSocket backend port via `VITE_WS_BACKEND_PORT` build env or `window.__WS_BACKEND_PORT__` runtime override (default: 5001)

### Changed
- UI proxy layer replaced with Nginx serving compiled React static assets; JWT stored in `sessionStorage`, sent as `Authorization: Bearer` on all API calls
- Settings backup calls `GET /api/database/export`; removed the non-functional restore-config handler
- Backend API port 5001 now binds on all interfaces (required for browser WebSocket connections from LAN); firewall recommendation documented in `.env.example`
- `PROXY_CONTAINER_NAME` default corrected to `secure-proxy-manager-proxy` to match `container_name` in `docker-compose.yml`
- Removed `FLASK_ENV` environment variable (unused after UI proxy refactor)
- `.env.example` ships with empty credentials; services refuse to start if `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`/`BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` are unset or set to `admin`

### Fixed
- Blacklist entries not appearing after add: `useApi` hook returns the unwrapped array; component was double-unwrapping via `.data` property
- 401 interceptor reloading the page on wrong-password during login (should only reload on session expiry)
- GeoIP import URL and User-Agent header
- Geo-block multi-country support (TypeScript build error)
- Malwaredomains.com URL replaced with URLhaus (upstream offline)
- Import timeouts raised for large blocklist URLs

## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- IP whitelist UI and backend CRUD (`/api/ip-whitelist`): IPs and CIDR networks that bypass Squid's direct-IP block rule
- Popular Lists one-click import for IP and domain blocklists (Firehol Level 1, Spamhaus DROP, Emerging Threats, StevenBlack, URLhaus, Phishing Army)
- Real-time log summary stat cards on the Logs page (total, success, blocked, error counts)
- VitePress documentation site deployed to GitHub Pages
- API end-to-end test suite (`tests/e2e_test.py`) configurable via env vars for CI

### Changed
- Squid `http_access allow ip_whitelist` rule now precedes `http_access deny direct_ip_*`
- `init.sh` warns on empty or `admin` credentials and exits before starting services

### Fixed
- Historical logs not persisting after page navigation
- Dashboard stat fields aligned to actual API response keys
- Blacklists page field names aligned to API response (`ip`, `added_date`)
- Settings page initialization converts the API array format to a key/value map
- Sidebar health indicator polls `/health` for real connected/disconnected state
- SQLi parameter binding, SSRF protection on import URLs, WAF memory leak, thread pool DoS protection, Squid de-escalated from root

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- Complete backend rewrite from Flask to FastAPI with Uvicorn and SQLite WAL mode
- Frontend rewritten from Bootstrap/Jinja2 to React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- UI proxy layer (Flask) now only serves static React assets and reverse-proxies API/WebSocket traffic
- README project structure, API paths, env vars, and acknowledgements updated to match actual code

### Added
- WebSocket log streaming with one-time token authentication (`/api/ws-token` + `/api/ws/logs`)
- IP whitelist management UI and backend (`/api/ip-whitelist` CRUD) — bypass direct-IP block for trusted LAN IPs
- Geo-based IP blocklist import (`/api/blacklists/import-geo`)
- PDF analytics report export (`/api/analytics/report/pdf`)
- SIEM syslog forwarding with JSON formatter
- CORS origin restriction via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var
- Rate limiting on authentication (5 attempts per 5 minutes, per IP)
- Real traffic timeline endpoint (`/api/logs/timeline`) powering the 24h dashboard chart
- Security score endpoint (`/api/security/score`)
- End-to-end API test suite (`tests/e2e_test.py`) configurable via env vars

### Fixed
- Squid `http_access allow ip_whitelist` rule now correctly precedes `http_access deny direct_ip_*` rules so whitelisted destination IPs are not blocked by the direct-IP block
- Dashboard stat fields aligned to actual API response keys (`total_count`, `blocked_count`, `ip_blocks_count`)
- Blacklists page field names aligned to API response (`ip`, `added_date` instead of `ip_address`, `created_at`)
- Settings page initialization now correctly converts the API's array format to a key/value map
- Sidebar API health indicator now polls `/health` and shows real connected/disconnected state
- Backend API port bound to `127.0.0.1:5001` only — no external exposure

### Security
- SSRF protection on import URLs using `ipaddress` module (blocks all private, loopback, link-local, reserved ranges)
- Database export redacts sensitive settings (tokens, webhook URLs, SIEM credentials)
- WebSocket endpoint requires a single-use token fetched through the authenticated HTTP proxy
- `cache/statistics` endpoint no longer returns fabricated numbers; returns `simulated: true` when Squid mgr interface is unavailable
- Replaced `admin:admin` defaults in all README curl examples with `YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASS` placeholders

## [1.0.0] - 2024-11-15

- HTTPS filtering with SSL certificate management
- Comprehensive logging and analysis
- Configuration backup and restore
- Health check endpoints
- Docker containerization with docker-compose
- Role-based access control
